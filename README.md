# BsMax 2.80 ~ 3.0

BsMax is package of many different tools and UI simulator (much as possible) for [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/).

* Animatable Primitive Objects.
* Many Different tools.
* Make you comfortable if you are from other software (for now mostly 3DsMax).
* BsMax do not makes dependency in you project. you can continue your project on other Blender without BsMax.
* Note: the only future the will not works without BsMax is "Animated Primitives" (Not the static ones).

The goal of UI simulator is people that came from other software (like me) feel comfortable or who has to switch frequently between Blender or other software do not be confused.

Your Reports and Ideas will help me alot and don't forget the sharing. let more people who needs this stuff know this is exist.

# Slow for a while

Do not worry about slowing down of Updates. it`s time to learn Blender c++ coding to be able develope better tools. for this reason updating the BsMax will bee slower for a while, but Bug fix and Adapt for new version of Blender still has high-priority.

* Go to Preferences > Addons > Install.
* Select the .zip file you downloaded.
* Select the Software you use to use.
