BsMax is package of Modeling, Rig & Animation, Render tools and UI mimic for [Blender 3D](https://www.blender.org/).

* Interactive & Animatable Primitive Mesh & Curve Objects.
* Modeling, Rigging, Animation, Pipeline tools.
* Make you comfortable if you are from other software (for now mostly 3DsMax).
* BsMax do not makes dependency in projects. Projects can be continue on other machines without BsMax with no problems.
* Note: the only future that not works without BsMax is "Animated Primitives" (Not the static ones).

The goal of UI simulator is people that came from other software (like me) feel comfortable or who has to switch frequently between Blender or other software do not be confused.

Your Reports and Ideas will help me alot and don't forget the sharing. let more people who needs this stuff know this is exist.
