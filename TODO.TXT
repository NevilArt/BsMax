Note: Tasks in [] can't apply for now because of python API limitation, I am looking for solution.

# Keymaps/Menu
	[Loop ring short key in UV Editor]
	Brush Size control hot keys (for max mode)
	Sequencer in pr mode Alt + Arrows move step by step
	[F9 if no active camera in scene create one befor render and delete after render]
	Shader editor A assyn to selected
	Disable F9 (max quick render) for other actions if exist

# Tools
	UV editor Target Weld

	Make rectangular UV
	Instancer / Make Unique
	Weld tool setting dialog
	Topology symmetry tool
	[3DsMax Navigation operator (change navigation type without release the Alt key)]
	Clone object shift drag
	Extrude open edge with shift drag
	Mimic the Slice modifire quick setup
	Slide zoom Operator for maya navigation mode
	video sequencer set current frame as first or last frame (range tool)
	Network render manager
	Global transform offset tool for selected objects in selected range
	Armature
		Pos snapshot (quick reset to rest pose)
		Smartkey mode (new key type same as previes key type)

# Issue
	Convert to (make Unique and apply all modifiers)
	Helix height and last segment
	Edge mode delete face most desolve edges too
	Bone to Bone link_to net to fix transform
	[Press 'S' while navigation hade to toggle Snap rather than the scale in max mode]
	Mirro operator not working.
	Undo
		Chamfer Curve
	joystick connecto: check for mesh and armature condition is ok for opration or not
	Convert to for curve objects apply modifiers do not work

# Update
	Enable snap for drawing primitives
	Zoom extended no select mesh/curve
	Zoom extended on limit gride area
	Helix with bezier segments with less count of knots (Bezier points)
	PickOperator had works on other modes to (Subtarget to object or another subtarget)
	Primitives save last created parameters value
	Crearte primitive weel for segment count
	If an object created uncheck hide that type of object in view port
	Create area light set as rectangular rather than squer
	Show/Hide Gride has to works on flat views too.
	Put transform type in in right tool panel on/off with f12
	transform type in sub object and pivot helper
